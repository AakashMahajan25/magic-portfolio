## Overview

Omni Vibe is a B2B AI automation platform that helps businesses streamline their workflows and automate repetitive tasks. The platform provides a visual workflow builder, AI-powered task automation, and comprehensive analytics to improve operational efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Visual Workflow Builder**: Created an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for building complex automation workflows with conditional logic and branching
- **AI-Powered Automation**: Integrated machine learning models for intelligent task classification, data extraction, and process optimization
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Built comprehensive analytics dashboards with real-time monitoring, performance metrics, and KPI tracking
- **API Integration Hub**: Developed connectors for 100+ popular business tools including Slack, Salesforce, HubSpot, and custom APIs
- **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Implemented secure multi-tenant system supporting 100+ clients with isolated data and custom branding

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, React Flow for workflow builder
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express, PostgreSQL, Redis for caching and job queues
- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API, TensorFlow.js for client-side ML, Python microservices for heavy processing
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (ECS, RDS, S3), CloudFlare for CDN
- **Monitoring**: DataDog for APM, Sentry for error tracking, custom analytics

## Technical Challenges

The biggest challenge was building a scalable visual workflow builder that could handle complex automation logic while maintaining excellent performance. This required implementing efficient state management, optimizing re-renders, and creating a robust execution engine for workflows. The multi-tenant architecture also needed careful design to ensure data isolation and security.

## Outcome

Omni Vibe successfully serves 100+ B2B clients and has automated over 50,000 workflows. The platform reduced dashboard load time by 45% through optimization efforts and helped clients save an average of 15 hours per week through automation. The visual workflow builder has a 95% user satisfaction rate.
